# Model Artifacts

This directory stores serialized machine learning models generated by the `ExoplanetModel` training utilities.

- `exoplanet_classifier.joblib`: Random forest classifier trained on synthetic transit simulations.

Artifacts are generated automatically when the API or tests first invoke the ML pipeline. To refresh the model, delete the artifact and run the training script or trigger the API inference to retrain.
